# crypto-dev-notes
Notes taken as projects are built and courses are taken. This is starting out as a raw brain dump of notes, observations, project ideas, and more. Over time as this evolves, will try to adjust this to be more structured for newcomers.


## Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript â€“ 32-Hour Course

### General notes
- *Blockchain Oracle* - Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts
- The difference between smart contracts and hybrid smart contracts have some off chain data component
- Web 1 --> permissionless open sourced web with static content
- Web 2 --> permissioned web w/ dynamic content. Companies run *your* agreements on *their* servers
- Web 3 --> permissionless web w/ dynamic content. Decentralized censorship resistant networks run *your* agreements. *You* also own part of the protocol instead of just the product
- SCs (smart contracts) pave the way for immutable, trust minimized agreements. The three key points are decentralization, flexibility & transparency, and speed & efficiency (TODO: give an example of how to read and interpret a deployed SC. It would be especially nice to show counterparty risk being removed in the example)
